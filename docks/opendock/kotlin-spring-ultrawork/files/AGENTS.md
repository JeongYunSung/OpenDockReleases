# Kotlin Spring Ultrawork

This workspace uses Kotlin Spring Ultrawork as an OpenDock-managed quality gate.

## Before Handoff

1. Apply the checklist in `HARNESS.md`.
2. Run `node .opendock/harness/check.mjs` when Node is available.
3. Fix failures before claiming the work is done.
4. If a failure is intentionally accepted, document the owner and reason.

## Focus

- Gradle wrapper must exist.
- ktlintCheck, detekt, test, build, and bootJar must be available.
- application.yml must not contain literal secrets.
- Controller DTOs should use validation.
- Transaction boundaries must be explicit around write flows.
- Readiness and health checks should be present.
