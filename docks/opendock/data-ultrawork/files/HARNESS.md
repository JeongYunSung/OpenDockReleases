# Data Ultrawork Harness

Data quality gate for SQL safety, destructive queries, timezone clarity, metric definitions, PII masking, and dashboard cost.

## Required Review

- SQL should avoid select * in shared analytics.
- Destructive queries require review and rollback notes.
- Date and timezone assumptions must be explicit.
- Metric definitions should be documented before dashboard use.
- PII columns must be masked or excluded.
- Dashboard query cost and cardinality need review.

## Commands

```bash
node .opendock/harness/check.mjs
sh .opendock/harness/check.sh
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.opendock/harness/check.ps1
```

Treat failures as blockers unless a human owner documents the exception.
