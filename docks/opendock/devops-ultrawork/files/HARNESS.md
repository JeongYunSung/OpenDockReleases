# DevOps Ultrawork Harness

DevOps quality gate for Terraform, Kubernetes, Helm, secrets, public exposure, image tags, resource limits, and runbooks.

## Required Review

- Terraform must be fmt-checked and validated.
- Helm and Kubernetes manifests need lint/schema validation.
- Secret scan is mandatory before handoff.
- Public buckets, public security groups, and privileged containers require review.
- Image tags must not use latest.
- Rollback and runbook docs should exist for deployable changes.

## Commands

```bash
node .opendock/harness/check.mjs
sh .opendock/harness/check.sh
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.opendock/harness/check.ps1
```

Treat failures as blockers unless a human owner documents the exception.
